      What a strange town was that, the San Francisco of 1856, its 30,000 people
      in speedy transition from a city of tents and shacks to one of brick and
      stone buildings, architecturally on a par with those of Atlantic seaboard
      cities, and its flimsy wooden and more pretentious sheet iron buildings
      filling in the spaces in between.

      The idea of permanency had come to prosperous Argonauts, and some of the
      three-story brick and granite buildings, then erected endure to this day,
      having survived all of San Francisco's trembling troubles, redevelopment
      and devastating fires.

      A visitor to 1856 San Francisco could pass down Montgomery Street and
      pause at the northwest corner of California Street in front of the granite
      building erected in 1852, which so long was the headquarters of Wells
      Fargo & Co.'s Express and the Union Club, and stop again at the corner of
      Washington Street to look upon the "Montgomery Block," built in 1853, and
      in which at different periods many of San Francisco's most noted men have
      had their offices, and where that part of the valuable Sutro Library which
      escaped the disaster of 1906, was housed.
