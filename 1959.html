      But in 1959, a staff photographer went up in a helicopter for a then-rare,
      but illuminating, view of San Francisco from above.

      While on the hunt in the newspaper's basement archive for photos for a
      previous column, I found an otherwise nondescript folder filed under “San
      Francisco Views.”

      This latest find was about 10 packs of 4-by-5 negatives labeled “Aerial
      photos of S.F.” taken in July 1959 by Chronicle photographer Duke Downey,
      many of them not seen in 60 years.
